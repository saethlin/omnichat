# A TUI chat client for all the things

I really dislike how much my chromebook lags while trying to use Slack, Discord, and other messaging services. This is my attempt to bring a bunch of messaging services together with a fast interface. That's currently a TUI because GUI is hard and I mostly want to send and receive text.

Working on: 
## Slack
* More commands like /join and /leave 
* Need a plan for threads
* Default emoji autocomplete
* Handle disconnect+reconnect

## Discord
* Working out how to request the unread cursor
* Mentions support

## UI
* Better /url regex
* Support for edits and deletions
